Version control systems are software that help track changes make in code over time. As a developer edits code, the version control system takes a snapshot of the files. It then saves that snapshot permanently so it can be recalled later if needed


Version control system to keep track of different version of your software
Use case : suppose you face a bug when you have updated the project so you need to revert back to previous version which can only be possible if the old version is stored somewhere . This is where the git comes into picture which keep tracks of all different versions 

Ex: For example we have a project with version 1.2.5 and we made some changes and deployed a new version 1.2.6 . Due to unforeseen issues there causes a bug   so immediately you have to revert back changes to 1.2.5 version in order to avoid downtime of you application

Repository -- Project folder or a package which contains all your code files and dependencies

Function: save the changes and keep track of versions

Remote Repository : repository stored remotely on some server or any other cloud providers
Ex: bitbucket , azure devops etc ,git lab,github

Github is one example of remote repository hosting service

Local Repository: the local machine on which your code or project is developed is called local repository

Staging area: The staging area is like a rough draft space, it's where you can git add the version of a file or multiple files that you want to save in your next commit (in other words in the next version of your project).

Note that you can copy versions of files into the staging area and also take them out of the staging area before you make your commit which is why I referred to it as a rough draft space.


What the git add command actually does is copy that version of your file from your working directory to the staging area.

The journey a file takes to have an updated version of it added to your repository:

1) It is edited in your working directory. The working directory is like a work bench it is where you edit your files, add new files and delete files.
2) Then the file is added to the staging area using the git add command
3) Finally it is included in the next commit when you use the git commit command

Working Directory:
